## Rain-Predection-Weather-Predection-Using-MLR

The project aims is to develop a reliable rain-detecting weather prediction model using the Multiple Linear Regression (MLR) Algorithm. It was evaluated
using various metrics such as Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) and Mean Absolute Error (MAE). The study also highlighted the potential applications of the MLR
algorithm in various fields, including transportation, agriculture, and disaster management, where reliable weather predictions are crucial. The study contributes to the
ongoing research on machine learning algorithms for weather prediction and provides insights into the use of MLR for rain detection. The limitations of the study
included the availability and quality of historical weather and rainfall data and the assumptions made in the MLR model. This project result can be used by policymakers, farmers, transportation operators, and disaster management organizations to make decisions based on accurate weather predictions.

## MLR

Multiple Linear Regression (MLR) is a statistical modeling technique used to predict a continuous dependent variable based on multiple independent variables. It helps to understand how these independent variables collectively influence the dependent variable.

Let's consider an example of MLR for rain prediction. Suppose we want to predict the amount of rainfall (in millimeters) based on temperature, humidity, wind speed, and cloud cover. Here, rainfall is the dependent variable, and temperature, humidity, wind speed, and cloud cover are the independent variables.

The MLR equation for this example would be:

Rainfall = β0 + β1Temperature + β2Humidity + β3Wind Speed + β4Cloud Cover + ε

Rainfall represents the amount of rainfall we want to predict.

Temperature, Humidity, Wind Speed, and Cloud Cover are the independent variables that influence the rainfall.

β0, β1, β2, β3, β4 are the regression coefficients, indicating the impact of each independent variable on the rainfall.
